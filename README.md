### Deliverable 3: A written analysis of the results
1. overview of project: The purpose of this analysis was to see how a play campaign's outcome related to the campaign's fundraising goal and launc date
2. analysis and challenges: use images and links to code
3. results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
	- Campaigns for plays launched in May show the highest rate of reachhing successful funding outcomes.
	- Launching a campaign in December resulted in roughly the same percentage of successful and canceled outcomes.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	- The percentage of successful champaigns was greater than that of failed champaigns when the goal amount was less than $15,000 and when the goal amount was between $35,000-$45,000.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	- We could create a graph looking at the length of time need for a successful play chamaign to reach it's fundraising goal. This could be visualized with a scatter plot with the amount of time needed (say nummber of days) on the x-axis and the monetary amount raised on the y-axis.
